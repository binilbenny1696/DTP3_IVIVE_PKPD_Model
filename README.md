# ðŸ”¬ DTP3_IVIVE_PKPD_Model

This project uses **in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE)** and **PK/PD modeling in R** to simulate the therapeutic potential of **DTP3**, a GADD45Î²/MKK7 pathway disruptor under investigation for **multiple myeloma**. Simulations assess single and multiple dosing regimens (BID/TID) using **IC50 data from cell viability assays**, and predict plasma concentrations and % inhibition using a two-compartment PK model and an Emax PD model.

---

## ðŸ§ª Project Objective

- Translate preclinical **IC50 and safety threshold** data to human plasma levels.
- Simulate PK using 2-compartment IV bolus model with humanized parameters.
- Apply Emax model to predict % inhibition over time.
- Compare **BID vs. TID** dosing for 24-hour target coverage.

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Findings

- **TID dosing** resulted in higher trough levels and sustained % inhibition over 24 hrs.
- **Peak concentration** (~7.5 ÂµM) stayed **below toxicity threshold (10 ÂµM)**.
- Efficacy sustained for **>60% inhibition** across 24 hours in TID, while BID fell short.
